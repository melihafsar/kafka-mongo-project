## Have a Question

Before asking a question, it is best to search for existing Issues in the [repository](https://github.com/melihafsar/kafka-mongo-project/issues) that may help you. If you find a relevant issue and still need clarification, you can ask your question. It is also recommended to search the internet for answers before asking.

If you still feel the need to ask a question and require clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/melihafsar/kafka-mongo-project/issues).
- Provide as much context as possible about what you are experiencing.
- Provide details about the project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc.) depending on what seems relevant.

We will address the issue as soon as possible.

### Making a Suggestion

This section guides you in submitting a development proposal for kafka-mongo-project, including entirely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community understand your suggestion and find relevant proposals.

#### Before Making a Suggestion

- Make sure you are using the latest version.
- Read the readme file carefully and learn if the functionality is covered by maybe an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/melihafsar/kafka-mongo-project/issues) to see if the improvement is already proposed. If so, add a comment to the existing issue rather than creating a new one.
- Determine if your idea fits within the scope and objectives of the project. It's up to you to create a strong case to convince the project developers of the benefits of this feature. Remember that we want features that will be useful not only to a small subset but to the majority of our users. If you are targeting only a small user base, consider writing a plugin/extension library.

#### How Can I Make a Good Development Proposal?

Development proposals are tracked on the [Issues](https://github.com/melihafsar/kafka-mongo-project/issues) page.

- Use a clear and descriptive **title** to identify the proposal.
- Provide a **step-by-step description** of the proposed development with as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain what behavior you expect to see instead** and why. This is also the point where you can indicate which alternatives did not work for you.
- Include **screenshots and animated GIFs** that help to show steps or indicate the relevant section of the proposal.
- **Explain why this development would be useful for many Project-Management-Web-Application-React users**. You may also want to mention other projects that solve this better and can serve as inspiration.
